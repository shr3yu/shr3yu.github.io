# Gesture-Controlled Robot Car
Tech Stack: ESP32, SPI/UART, GPIO, C++, Arduino, I2C

## Overview
Developed a gesture-controlled car that navigates wirelessly using the ESP32-NOW protocol. The system consists of a transmitter (controller) and receiver (car), enabling low-latency, peer-to-peer motion-based control for robotics and automation applications.
