# Semi-conductor Charge Simulation
Tech Stack: C++, OpenGL, GLSL, GLFW, RTOS

## Overview
Built a real-time simulation visualizing electron dynamics in the conduction band using OpenGL. The project accounts Coulomb forces, Brownian motion, and drift across 100+ particles at 60 FPS to replicate charge behavior in semiconductor materials.

## Main Motivation
I wanted to explore n-type and p-type MOSFET strcuture and behaviour, and understand conduction and valence band transitions.

## Key Takeaways
- Semiconductor physics
- GPU-based Parrallel visualization
- RTOS-style sceduling
- System optimization & Debugging
