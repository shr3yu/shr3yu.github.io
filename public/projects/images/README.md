# Projects Images Folder

Place your project images here. These images will be displayed in the notepad popup when referenced in your markdown files.

## Usage:

In your markdown files (e.g., `Project1.md`), reference images like this:

```markdown
![Screenshot of the app](screenshot.png)
![Architecture diagram](architecture.jpg)
```

The image filename should match the file you place in this folder.

## Supported formats:
- PNG (.png)
- JPG/JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- GIF (.gif)
- SVG (.svg)
- WebP (.webp)

## Notes:
- Images will automatically scale to fit the notepad width
- Use descriptive filenames for better organization
- Keep file sizes reasonable for faster loading
